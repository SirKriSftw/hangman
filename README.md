# hangman
Upon running "ruby lib/hangman.rb" you should be prompted with the question if you want to load a past game. (You should have no past games so just say N)
A new game will start up, the length of the word is displayed with the number of "_"s and your lives are on the right displayed with ♥
You have 7♥s to begin. At 0 ♥s you get 1 more chance before losing.
To save a game simply just type save as your guess. It'll save the file as the date and time of saving and appear in your saved_games dir
